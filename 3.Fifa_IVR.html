                            <p>This case study, conducted as part of an application for a Data Engineer position at FIFA, was based on sample data and focused on analyzing year-to-date (YTD) metrics from FIFA’s Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system. The objective was to identify areas for optimization by cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing the data. Given the strict four-day timeframe, this project tested my ability to manage time effectively, solve problems under pressure, and apply technical skills in a professional context.</p>

                            <p>As my first professional case study for an interview, this was both a challenging and rewarding experience. It allowed me to showcase my technical expertise in data preprocessing, SQL analysis, and KPI reporting while gaining insights into opportunities for personal growth. The sample data provided a realistic scenario, enabling me to analyze FIFA’s IVR system and suggest actionable improvements grounded in the data.

												<p>In this Dashboard Year-Over-Year calculations on total IVR instances were completed. There was a 78 % increase in uses in 2023 compared to 2024.

												<p>Using Langauges as a method of analysis I was able to conclude that English had the lionshare of IVR instances at 76% whereas German had the least with 2% over 2023.

												<p>Total IVR represents the combination of all 5 languages sampled and their day to day metrics. While most of the days were similar in the amount of instances the Fifa IVR was utilized there are some outliers. For example, the date with the highest instances of IVR's was 18/8/23 with 523. In the 2022 instances there was a day with a very strong outlier which was 06-07-22 with 1,039 instances. This is something I would need more data or information on to complete. </p>

The most common topic of concern across all languages was “Already Submitted an Application,” comprising 19.44% of interactions. To enhance engagement for non-English users, particularly German speakers, consider expanding localized options or addressing potential gaps in the IVR system for these audiences.</p>

                                        <p>With an 84% effectiveness rate in 2023, the IVR system successfully resolved most customer inquiries. However, weekday usage far exceeded weekends, reflecting customer interaction patterns. To maintain high effectiveness, consider reinforcing weekday resources while exploring opportunities to increase weekend support availability, such as deploying targeted self-service options during off-peak times.</p>

                                        <p>Usage spikes on dates like 06-07-22 (1,039 instances) and 18-08-23 (523 instances) highlight potential events or factors driving increased IVR demand. Additionally, the 78% year-over-year increase in usage from 2022 to 2023 underscores growing adoption. Investigate these outliers to understand their causes, such as marketing campaigns or external events, and use these insights to predict and prepare for similar future surges. </p>
