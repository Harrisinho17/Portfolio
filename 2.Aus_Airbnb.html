                                    <p>This project draws inspiration from my love of traveling and exploring new places. While browsing Airbnbs worldwide, I found myself particularly drawn to Brisbane due to my strong connection to the city. This led me to combine my passion for travel with data analytics in my first self-guided project. It was an exciting experience, as I could validate my findings by discussing them with friends currently living in Australia, gaining insights into why certain areas are priced higher than others. Check out the repository below. </p>

                                        <p>1 ~ The average daily rates of listings by location has a significant correlation with the neighbourhood and property type. Listings in more afluent areas tend to garner a larger daily rate.</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>2 ~ A slight preference towards private room or entire home listings over hotel rooms and shared rooms is evident after analyzing the data. This results in these types of listings being vacant for less amount of time through the year.</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>3 ~ Autumn is the most active time of the year that listings are occupied. A productive action could be decreasing the average daily rate during the Winter and Spring months to increase total occupancy throughout the year resulting in increased revenue. </p>

                                        <h2>Host and Property Insights</h2>
                                        <p>4 ~  An increase in reviews has little to no correlation to the average rating a consumer will reward a specific Airbnb listing. Which for the region of Brisbane, QLD is between 4.0 and 4.2 when excluding outliers like listings with less that 5 reviews.</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>5 ~  There is virtually no change in Airbnb prices over the past year and that the average price for an airbnb listing ranges between 50 and 200. There does seem to be an outlier in Pullenvale that could be the result of a Host changing, remvoing or adding a listing. Data going back further in years would be beneficial to show a clearer picture of how pricing has changed over time in Brisbane.</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>6 ~ Hotel Room's have the highest average cost at $246 per night and Private Room listings have the lowest average cost at $124. This data shows a similar trend in the prices not changing over time because the data set is from 6/7/2024 to 6/6/2025. This project would benefit from collecting a larger data set and analyzing further.</p>

                                        <p>7 ~ Listings in Brisbane did not vary their prices over the sampled time frame. I believe adjusting the price during the slower seasons may benefit the occupancy rate. That being said, during my analysis I realized my sample size may not be sufficent enough to answer this question.</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>8 ~ istings are wide spread throughout Brisabne with a majority of them being located near the Central Business District or CBD. This analysis may benefit from taking into account amenities and other periphery information about the listing.</p>
